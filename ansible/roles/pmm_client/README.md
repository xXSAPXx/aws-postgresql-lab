# PostgreSQL lock blocking for PMM

PostgreSQL keeps no history of lock waits, and PMM shows none for it: Query Analytics has no lock time for PostgreSQL, and the standard dashboards only count locks by mode. After a pile-up you know that sessions waited, not who was in their way.

This role adds that to PMM with two files that also work outside the lab:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [templates/lock-blocking.yml.j2](templates/lock-blocking.yml.j2) | Three custom queries for PMM's PostgreSQL exporter |
| [files/postgresql-lock-blocking-dashboard.json](files/postgresql-lock-blocking-dashboard.json) | The dashboard "PostgreSQL lock blocking" |

Tested on PMM 3.9.1 (server and client) with Percona Server for PostgreSQL 17.

## How it works

Every 5 seconds (PMM's high resolution) the exporter samples `pg_stat_activity` and records who is blocking whom.

- **Root blocker.** PostgreSQL reports sessions queued on the same row as blocking each other: 59 sessions waiting behind one blocker gave 975 "blocked by" pairs in a test. The queries follow each queue back to its root, the session that is in the way and is not waiting on a lock itself.
- **Persisting blockers only.** A root blocker is reported once its transaction has been open for 1 second. A healthy database has many lock waits of a few milliseconds: 20 clients updating one row at 407 transactions per second showed a "blocker" in 28 of 30 unfiltered samples, and in none with the filter.
- **The filter is on the blocker, not on the waiting sessions.** A session that gives up after its `lock_timeout` never waits long. With a 2 s timeout, counting only sessions that had waited over 1 s gave between 0 and 12 for a blocker that held 12 sessions up the whole time.
- **Once per server.** The exporter runs a custom query in every database unless it is marked `master: true`. These queries cover the whole server, so they are marked.

## Metrics

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pg_lock_blocking_sessions` | `datname`, `blocking_user`, `blocking_application`, `blocking_state` | Sessions waiting behind these root blockers, directly or in a queue |
| `pg_lock_blocking_blockers` | same | How many sessions of that user and application are root blockers |
| `pg_lock_blocking_transaction_seconds` | same | How long the oldest of their transactions has been open |
| `pg_lock_blocking_statement_sessions` | the same, plus `blocking_query` | The same count per statement of the root blocker, for the ten that block the most |
| `pg_lock_blocking_statement_transaction_seconds` | the same, plus `blocking_query` | How long that blocker's transaction has been open |
| `pg_lock_waiting_sessions` | `datname`, `waiting_user`, `waiting_application` | Every session waiting on a lock, however briefly |

The first three have few, stable series: use them for graphs. The statement metrics carry the statement text (first 100 characters) as a label.

## The dashboard

| Row | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Now** | Sessions waiting, sessions blocked by a persisting blocker, blocking sessions, the oldest blocking transaction, and the blocked session-seconds of the time range |
| **Who blocks** | Sessions blocked over time by blocking user and by application; blocked session-seconds by user; the age of each user's oldest blocking transaction |
| **What they run** | The blocking statements, with the most sessions each blocked, its blocked session-seconds and how long its transaction was open |
| **Who waits** | Sessions waiting over time, by waiting user and by application |
| **PostgreSQL's own counters** | PMM's standard metrics: locks held by mode, deadlocks |

- **Blocked session-seconds** is sessions blocked × seconds: the waiting a user or statement caused. 20 sessions blocked for 3 s and 5 sessions blocked for 12 s are both 60. It ranks blockers by impact rather than by peak.
- **To see one user's statements,** click the user in a "by blocking user" panel and choose **Show only this user**, or pick it in the **Blocking user** filter. Every panel, including the statements table, then shows only that user.
- **Sample interval** must equal PMM's high resolution (5 s by default). The session-seconds are the samples multiplied by it.

## Install it in another PMM

1. **The query file.** In `lock-blocking.yml.j2`, replace the three `{{ pmm_client_lock_blocking_min_seconds }}` with the threshold in seconds, for example `1`. Or copy the finished file from a lab database server: `/usr/local/percona/pmm/collectors/custom-queries/postgresql/high-resolution/lab-lock-blocking.yml`.
2. **Where it goes.** On every host where a PMM agent runs the PostgreSQL exporter, into `/usr/local/percona/pmm/collectors/custom-queries/postgresql/high-resolution/`, owner `pmm-agent`, mode `0640`. The exporter picked it up within 20 seconds, without a restart of the agent.
3. **Permissions.** PMM's monitoring user must be a member of `pg_monitor`, or it can't see other users' sessions and statements.
4. **The dashboard.** In PMM: **Dashboards → New → Import**, and upload the JSON file.
5. **Check it.** Hold a row in one session and update it from another:
   ```sql
   -- session 1
   BEGIN; UPDATE some_table SET some_column = some_column WHERE id = 1;
   -- session 2: waits. After a few seconds the dashboard shows session 1's user blocking 1 session.
   UPDATE some_table SET some_column = some_column WHERE id = 1;
   -- session 1
   ROLLBACK;
   ```

## Cost

Measured with `pg_stat_monitor` on the lab (2 vCPUs, about 100 requests per second):

| | |
|---|---|
| Runs | 12 per minute for each of the three queries, in one database |
| Time per run | 0.8 to 1.4 ms on average, 5 ms at worst during a pile-up |
| 59 sessions waiting behind one blocker | about 4 ms per run |

The cost grows with the square of a queue's length on one row, and each waiting session costs one call of `pg_blocking_pids()`, which briefly locks PostgreSQL's lock manager.

## Limits, and what is not tested yet

- **It samples.** A blocker that comes and goes between two samples is missed, and session-seconds are accurate to the sample interval.
- **The statement is the blocker's current or last one,** which is not always the one that took the lock. A batch job that locked rows with a quick `UPDATE` shows the long query it runs afterwards.
- **Statement text is a label.** Statements with literal values make a new series each time they block. The filter keeps this to real incidents, but it has not been run against a production workload.
- **Prepared transactions (two-phase commit) are not shown as blockers.** PostgreSQL reports them without a session. Their victims still appear under "Who waits".
- **Not tested:** PostgreSQL older than 17 (the queries need version 10 or newer), replicas, servers with many databases, more than 59 waiting sessions, and PMM 2.
- **The "Show only this user" link** assumes PMM serves Grafana under `/graph`.
