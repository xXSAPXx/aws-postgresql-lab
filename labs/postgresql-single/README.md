# Lab: postgresql-single

A single Percona PostgreSQL 17 server in a private subnet, monitored by PMM 3. Use it to practise configuration, query analysis with pg_stat_monitor and PMM, and the basics before the HA labs. pgBackRest and pg_repack are installed.

## What it deploys

- **VPC** `10.0.0.0/24`: one public subnet, two private subnets in two availability zones, and a NAT gateway.
- **postgresql-source**: Percona PostgreSQL 17 with pg_stat_monitor and data checksums, in private subnet 1. Its data lives on a separate encrypted gp3 volume (20 GB by default, mounted at `/var/lib/pgsql`). The configuration is sized from the server's RAM and CPUs (`conf.d/01-lab.conf`, every setting commented), and `pg_hba.conf` lets each user reach only its own database, only from the PMM server.
- **pmm-server**: PMM 3 (Docker) in the public subnet, also the SSH jump host and the application side: the labapp probe and the load tools (psql, pgbench). SSH and the PMM UI accept connections only from your `admin_cidr`.

Both servers run Rocky Linux 10 (the newest official image at deploy time): PostgreSQL on a t3.small, the PMM server on a t3.medium because it also generates the load. Change them with `postgresql_instance_type` and `pmm_instance_type` in `terraform.tfvars`; Rocky Linux 10 needs a current type such as t3 or m7i, not t2. For load tests, use a non-burstable type for PostgreSQL such as `m7i.large`: t3 instances are throttled once their CPU credits run out, which looks like a slow database in PMM.

**Cost:** about $0.12 per hour in us-east-1 while the lab runs (NAT gateway $0.045, t3.medium $0.042, t3.small $0.021, two public IPs $0.010, 40 GB of gp3 disks $0.004). Always run `terraform destroy` when you're done.

Terraform (`terraform/`) builds the infrastructure. Ansible (`ansible/`) installs and configures everything on the servers; [how the Ansible part works](../../ansible/README.md).

## Before your first deploy

Run all commands from a Linux or macOS shell. On Windows, use Ubuntu on WSL (see the [root README](../../README.md#before-your-first-lab)).

1. Copy `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform/terraform.tfvars` and set `aws_key_pair`, `admin_cidr` and `ssh_private_key_path`.
2. Add this line at the top of `~/.ssh/config`:
   ```
   Include aws-postgresql-lab.conf
   ```
3. Install the Ansible collections the lab needs (once, and after they change):
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install -r labs/postgresql-single/ansible/requirements.yml
   ```

## Deploy

```bash
cd labs/postgresql-single/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply              # about 3 minutes

cd ../ansible
ansible-playbook site.yml    # about 10 minutes on the first run
```

`terraform apply` also writes the SSH config (`~/.ssh/aws-postgresql-lab.conf`) and the Ansible inventory (`ansible/inventory.ini`) with the new IPs. The playbook installs PostgreSQL and PMM, generates the lab passwords into `ansible/credentials/`, registers PostgreSQL in PMM, and builds the shop database with Liquibase (the first run also generates its data, about 4 minutes).

## Connect

```bash
ssh pmm-server               # PMM server / jump host
ssh postgresql-source        # PostgreSQL, through the jump host
```

The PMM server only relays the connection (ProxyJump), so your private key never leaves your machine.

Database logins: on `postgresql-source`, `sudo -u postgres psql`; over the network from the PMM server, your admin user `dba` (password in `~/.pgpass`, also in `ansible/credentials/postgresql_dba_password`):

```bash
ssh pmm-server
psql -h postgresql-source -U dba postgres
```

PMM UI: the `pmm_url` from `terraform output`. Log in as `admin` with the password from `ansible/credentials/pmm_admin_password`.

## The shop database

The lab's application database: an online shop with 28 tables, about 40 foreign keys, hot rows and big tables, about 1.6 GB of generated data, and five documented production flaws to fix as exercises. It's built and changed only through Liquibase migrations: see [schema/shop](../../schema/shop/README.md).

To change the schema, add a migration file to `schema/shop/changes/` and apply only the migrations (seconds, everything else keeps running):

```bash
cd labs/postgresql-single/ansible
ansible-playbook migrate.yml
```

On the PMM server, `liquibase-shop status`, `update-sql`, `history` and `rollback-count` run Liquibase directly. The shop users log in from there too (passwords in `~/.pgpass`):

```bash
psql -h postgresql-source -U shop_app shop         # the application: DML only, 5 s statement timeout
psql -h postgresql-source -U shop_reporting shop   # reports: read-only
```

## Generate load

The PMM server acts as the application: it sends load to PostgreSQL over the network, like an application server would. `psql` and `pgbench` are installed there, and the `bench` user's password is in `~/.pgpass` (for `rocky` and `root`) for every PostgreSQL server of the lab, so you only name the server:

```bash
ssh pmm-server
pgbench -h postgresql-source -U bench -i -s 20 bench               # create ~300 MB of test data (once)
pgbench -h postgresql-source -U bench -c 8 -j 2 -T 300 -P 10 bench # 8 clients for 5 minutes, progress every 10 s
psql -h postgresql-source -U bench bench                           # SQL shell as the bench user
```

Watch the effect in PMM: **Dashboards → PostgreSQL → PostgreSQL Instance Summary**, and **Query Analytics**.

For a live view on the database server itself, two tools are installed. Run them as the `postgres` OS user:

```bash
ssh postgresql-source
sudo -iu postgres pg_activity    # overview
sudo -iu postgres pg_top         # drill down into one PID
```

- **[pg_activity](https://github.com/dalibo/pg_activity)**: all sessions with their queries, waits and per-process CPU / memory / IO. `F1` / `F2` / `F3` show running / waiting / blocking queries; select a process with the arrow keys and press `C` to cancel or `K` to terminate it. `h` lists all keys.
- **[pg_top](https://pg_top.gitlab.io/)**: press a key, then enter a PID. `Q` shows its full query, `E` its EXPLAIN plan, `L` the locks it holds. `A` runs EXPLAIN ANALYZE, which **executes the statement again**, so never use it on an UPDATE or DELETE.

## Measure downtime

While the lab runs, the [labapp probe](../../tools/labapp/README.md) on the PMM server writes to PostgreSQL four times a second, like an application would. Whatever you do to the database, it measures what the application experiences: every outage with its exact start, end and duration, and the write and connect latency.

- **In PMM:** the **Lab → Lab: Application probe** dashboard shows UP / DOWN, the ongoing outage, outages and downtime in the selected time range, and latency. Outages are also marked in red on PMM's PostgreSQL dashboards.
- **On the PMM server:** `labapp outages` lists every outage measured:
  ```bash
  ssh pmm-server
  labapp outages
  ```

Try it: `ssh postgresql-source`, run `sudo systemctl restart postgresql-17`, then check `labapp outages`. A restart costs the application about a second of write downtime.

## Break, fix, reset

Break whatever you like on the servers. Running `ansible-playbook site.yml` again puts everything Ansible manages back into the known-good state: packages, configuration files, the `pmm` user, services and the PMM registration. It changes only what differs. It does not restore data you deleted.

## Tear down

```bash
cd labs/postgresql-single/terraform
terraform destroy
```

This also removes the SSH config and the inventory. The passwords stay in `ansible/credentials/` and are reused on the next deploy.
