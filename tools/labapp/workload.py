"""labapp workload: the shop's application traffic (the labapp-workload service).

Open loop, like real users: requests arrive at the target rate whether or not the database keeps up. When it
slows down, requests queue for a free worker and the response time includes that wait. Workers (one connection
each, as shop_app) run them as business transactions. Long-running reports and batch jobs run on their own
schedules with their own roles (shop_reporting, shop_analytics, shop_batch).

Target rate = base rate x daily wave (one cycle per `wave.period`) x flash sale multiplier (0 while paused).
Control it live with `labapp load ...` (a local HTTP endpoint, 127.0.0.1 only).
